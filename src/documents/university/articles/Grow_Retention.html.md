# Dashboard - Rentention

## How often do your players return and engage with your game?

If your players find your game valuable, they'll keep coming back. The Retention reports show you how often your players come back and play your game. You can use the data in the Retention reports to track and measure if the changes you make to your game increase your player's retention and make changes to your game accordingly, to prevent churn.

We have three types of Retention reports, each report gives you a different perspective on your user's behavior:

### Regular Retention
In this report you can see how many *new users* / *first time users* played your game, you see the date in which they started playing and you can also see how many of them came back to play N days after they first came.

### Rolling Retention
Rolling Retention shows you of all the players who came to your game once over a specific period of time, how many are still around N days later. It's crucial to understand how quickly players stop coming back to your game in order to assess the validity of the game.

The report displays the percentage or actual number of players still active N days after they first installed and played your game, regardless of whether the players came back *each and every day*.

### Return Retention
This retention is different than the previous two since it shows which proportion of the players come back to the game at least once within N days.
It accounts for all active users on a certain date and shows you their return rate form that day on. This report lets you identify weaker and stronger days of gameplay over time.
