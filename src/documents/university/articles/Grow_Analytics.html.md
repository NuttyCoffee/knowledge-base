# Dashboard - Analytics

## Get to know your players

The [Analytics Dashboard](http://dashboard.soom.la/) provides you with useful informationabout your games. You can gain insights about your games' performance, analyze revenue, [retention](/university/articles/Grow_Retention) and a lot more.

#### DASHBOARD

In the main Dashboard you can see the number of Active Users your game has, you can also see the number of Paying Users, New Users, Revenue, number of Purchases and even what your users purchase the most.

This is sort of a high-level insight to your data and you can drill down by looking at the other sections such as Activity and Money.
