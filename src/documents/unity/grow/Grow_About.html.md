## About

Soomla GROW is SOOMLA's flagship, community-driven, data network. Mobile game studios can take advantage of the different GROW products in order to get valuable insights about their games' performance and increase retention and monetization.

GROW uses all of Soomla's modules: [Store](/unity/store/), [Profile](/unity/profile/) and [LevelUp](/unity/levelup/) to collect in-game data and render value for you. Studios may choose to use only specific modules, however, to benefit from the full power of GROW analytics we recommend that you integrate all three.

To get started with GROW, you can follow each one of different GROW bundles' tutorials:

- [GrowUltimate](/unity/grow/GrowUltimate_GettingStarted)
- [GrowCompete](/unity/grow/GrowCompete_GettingStarted)
- [GrowViral](/unity/grow/GrowViral_GettingStarted)
- [GrowSpend](/unity/grow/GrowSpend_GettingStarted)
- [GrowInsights](/unity/grow/GrowInsights_GettingStarted)


### Why use GROW?

- With GROW, you can take better actions on your users in order to increase **retention** and **monetization**. GROW's [Insights]() module will allow you to take actions at real time and the [Whales Reports]() will float problems you might have with your payers so you know how you improve over time.

- The Analytics dashboard will provide you with <u>free</u> data about your game when you join the GROW network. In the dashboard, you'll be able to see aggregative analytics about your games and investigate its performance. You will also see analytics about the different modules you incorporated in your game and be able to investigate fraudulent purchases.

- SOOMLA has created some modules that will put your game on steroids and by that increases user experience and engagement. [Social Leaderboards](), [Gifting]() and [State & Economy Sync]() are the features every F2P game needs in order to increase its <u>virality</u> and <u>user engagement</u>


## GROW Dashboard

< need to explain the GROW Dashboard here. with screenshots. >
< I left everything below here just in case we want to work with example. Needs to be changed >

### **Screen 1**

<br>

### **Screen 2**



- **ARPU** - Average Revenue Per User

For example, if you have 100 users, and only 1 of them paid $1.00, your ARPU will be

$1.00 / 100 users = **$0.01**.

- **ARPPU** - Average Revenue Per **Paying** User

Following the example above, you have 1 paying user that paid $1.00, so your ARPPU will be

$1.00 / 1 user = **$1.00**

- **TIMES PLAYED** - The average number of times your game has been played.

- **SESSION DURATION** - The average session duration.

#### **CONVERSION:**

![alt text](/img/tutorial_img/unity_grow/overviewConversion.png "Conversion")

This shows what percentage of your users make purchases in your game, rate your game, or connect with social networks, all according to the filters you chose at the top. For example, you can see that 1.8% of your users rated your game according to the filters chosen (All time, All countries, All devices). In comparison to the others, you're doing great, because the comparison statistic is 1.4%.

### **Conversion & Progression**

This screen shows the state of your users when they converted (purchased, rated, or 'liked'). You can filter by Conversion action, Date, Country, and Device. In the future, you will be able to filter by benchmark as well.

<br>

#### **CONVERSION MOMENT:**

![alt text](/img/tutorial_img/unity_grow/convMoment.png "Conversion Moment")

- **HAD** - On average, your users perform an action (purchase, rate, or 'like') after they had this number of a specific virtual currency or virtual good. For example, in the image above, the conversion action filter is set to "Purchase" and the filter for "HAD" is set to "Coins" - therefore, on average your users purchase after they had 873 coins.

- **PASSED LEVELS** - On average, your users perform an action (purchase, rate, or 'like') after they passed this number of levels (unique levels and total levels). For example, in the image above, the conversion action filter is set to "Purchase" - therefore, on average your users purchase after they passed 9 unique levels (24 total levels).

- **COMPLETED MISSIONS** - On average, your users perform an action (purchase, rate, or 'like') after they completed this number of missions. For example, in the image above, the conversion action filter is set to "Purchase" - therefore, on average your users purchase after they completed 0 missions.

<br>

#### **DAILY CONVERSION:**

![alt text](/img/tutorial_img/unity_grow/dailyConv.png "Daily Conversion")

This graph presents the number of users who performed the conversion action (purchase, rate, 'like') you chose in the date range you chose.

### **Countries & Devices**

In this part of the dashboard, you can filter by Date and Conversion action (purchase, rate, 'like').

<br>

#### **COUNTRIES:**

![alt text](/img/tutorial_img/unity_grow/countries.png "Countries")

Hover over any country on the map and see what percentage of your users in that country performed the action you defined in the filter. For example, in the image above, you can see that 4.1% of your **United States users** that played **yesterday** performed a **social** action in your game (e.g. Facebook connect, like, share status, etc.). You can see how you compare to other games that use GROW - the other games together have 6.0% for this metric, which means you're a bit behind.  This is a thoughtful insight that can lead you to re-evaluate social engagement in your game.

<br>

#### **DEVICES:**

![alt text](/img/tutorial_img/unity_grow/devices.png "Devices")

See the percentage of your users who performed the action you defined in the filter per device. For example, 4.5% of your iPhone users rated your game. 6.2% of the other games' iPhone users rated their games, so your game is a bit behind the benchmark.
